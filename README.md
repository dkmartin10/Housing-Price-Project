# Housing-Price-Project
## Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the final price of a house using regression techniques. The final model's performance was determined by the Root Mean Squared Error.
## Summary 
1. Explored the Data
    * found highly correlated features with the target varable
    * removed outliers
2. Cleaned the Data
    * removed columns with a significant amount of missing values
    * filled missing values with zero,median,or None.
3. Transformed features that were skewed
4. Feature Engineering
    * created more features that gave us better insight.
5. Built different regression models
    * used grid search as well as randomized search to find the hyperparamaters.
